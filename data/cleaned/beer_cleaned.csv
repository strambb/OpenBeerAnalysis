The potential of the beer was soon realised and ESB was installed as a permanent fixture, creating an immediate impact. 

Not only was it one of the strongest regularly brewed draught beers in the country (at 5.5% ABV), it was also one of the tastiest, and as the awareness of the beer grew, so did its popularity. ESB's reputation was soon enhanced after being named CAMRA's (Campaign for Real Ale) Beer of the Year in 1978, and the beer has not stopped winning since!

Scratch #19 2009 Imperial Double Expresso Oatmeal Stout,9.5,Troegs Brewing,Harrisburg,United States,40.2559,-76.8715,"Every beer tells a story, and some are longer than others.

Consider Scratch #19; originally designed as an enhanced take on Scratch #15 with a slightly higher ABV, our brewers went to town to deliver a brew slightly more akin to our fabled Scratch #5, the Imperial Oatmeal Stout brewed for The Flying Mouflan Experience.

For Scratch #19, we teamed up with St. Thomas Roasters of Linglestown to create a special blend of espresso beans. They added Kenyan beans to the mix because of a strong citrus flavor that compliments the hops. Creating en environment akin a French press, the beans are combined with whole flower hops in the hopback, and the hot wort passes through the vessel on the way to fermentation giving Scratch #19 a lush coffee espresso nose and hints of coffee flavor. There is a silky quality to the mouthfeel and a citrus hop finsh coming from the Kenyan beans and hops.

Some stories have twists, and unfortunately a faulty valve in the fermentation cellar led to a dramatic beer tragedy one afternoon in the brewery. Risking life and limb (while keeping his mouth open to sample the beer), a heroic brewery team member took the dive reconnecting the valve and saving about half the batch of Scratch #19.

So for your amusement (and our final relief), we give you a draft-only release of a third-take on a style that demands continued research for the Troegs Brewery staff. Enjoy!",British Ale,Oatmeal Stout

The morning of the scheduled hop delivery in Denver, Great Divideâ€™s brewers begin brewing Fresh Hop and are ready to hop the beer just as the fresh hops are delivered.

Using fresh hops is a big endeavor, requiring four to five times the volume of hops compared to the usual process of using pelletized hops. This complex process brings impressive results: Fresh Hop is an American-Style Pale Ale with moderate hop bitterness marked by a unique and intensely grassy hop flavor and aroma.

To balance the hop character, Deschutesâ€™ brewers used crystal and caraston malts that weave throughout the beer providing soft, complex caramel flavors. 

Just like clear days up on the mountain, Inversion I.P.A. will deliver a path to higher ground.

Daddy Fat Sacs Imperial IPA,7.5,Roy Pitz Brewing Company,Chambersburg,United States,39.939,-77.6566,"The one and only IPA that doesn't leave your pallet with a bitter after taste. This beer took years of practice to get down and when we finally got it right, we knew it. The beer is made with three malts in considerable additions that leave it with a more malty and sweet taste. There are five different hop additions that were carefully planed out to impart just enough bitterness to give it the body and depth that it needed without leaving you with the astringent and bitter aftertaste. We then added a plethora of English flavor and aroma hops that round out the floral and citrus esters. With the beer being so well balanced between bitter and sweet, we than added \big sacks\"" of bittering hops to the conditioning vessel to impart all the wonderful citrus and floral notes deep into the beer while leaving the bittering aspects of the hop behind. The result was a beer that makes you want to nose dive right in complimented by the well balanced taste of this wonderful brew.""",North American Ale,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale

Otter Creek Imperial India Pale Ale,11.0,Otter Creek Brewing & Wolaver's Organic Ales,Middlebury,United States,44.0197,-73.1693,"Originally brewed for thirsty British troops stationed on the subcontinent of India, India Pale Ales had to withstand the sea voyage around Africa. Brewers need to take full advantage of two preservatives at the time: hops and alcohol. They increased their hopping rates, doubled  their malt useage to increase alcohol content, and dry-hopped the brew before it set out on its voyage.
Our Imperial IPA carries on this tradition- and then some!  The fruity and citrusy hop aroma intermingles perfectly with an assertive malty backbone.  Our brewers added a generous supply of hops to this brew throughout the entire process to provide an enormous hop flavor and balance the elevated alcohol content.

The rest of the hop additions are blended at different IBU's (International Bittering Units) in groups of three hops per addition in order to create more hop complexity. At CCB, we love hops but also feel that balance is important for IPAs. So Jai Alai features a sturday caramel malt component which helps to create balance, staving off hop astringency.

The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol.  There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla.  The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter.  There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much.  Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer.  As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish.  The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel.

For the next several batches individual Troegs brewers will create recipes of their choice. First up, The Ticeman had a hankering for a sweet stout, so the Troegs brothers and all the brewers met with Scharffen Berger Chocolate Company engineers to eat ridiculous amounts of cocoa nibs and chocolates over a few pints of beer.

This collaboration resulted in the delivery of a special blend of cocoa nibs that were added during the boiling process. In addition to the nibs, lactose was added at the end of the boil to give a little sweetness in the body. The addition of Galena and Simcoe hops lends a subtle fruity balance. After primary fermentation, the beer was aged for three weeks on a blend of cocoa nibs and Ugandan vanilla beans.

Glacier Harvest '09 Wet Hop (100 Barrel Series #28),6.7,Harpoon Brewery - Boston,Boston,United States,42.3465,-71.0338,"For the 28th session of the Harpoon 100 Barrel Series, weâ€™re celebrating this yearâ€™s hop harvest with Glacier Harvest Wet Hop beer, a pale ale made with fresh Glacier hops.
 
Wet hop beers are brewed using fresh, â€œwetâ€ hops instead of traditional dried hopsâ€”hops contain about 60% moisture when they are first picked.

Typically, when hops are picked they are quickly dried and refrigerated to increase shelf life and make them more consistent for brewing. Freshly picked wet hops, however, need to be used within hours of harvest or they will begin to degrade rapidly. Wet hops retain more of their natural aroma and volatile flavors that dissipate when dried. This gives wet hop beers a fresher hop flavor and aroma than that of beers hopped with processed hops.
This yields an immersed, intense hop flavor in the beer.

Harpoon brewer Ray Dobens, creator of the beer, added a heroic dose of fresh hops the day of the harvest.The hop flavor and aroma from this copper-colored ale comes from a generous late addition of freshly harvested â€œwetâ€ hops.",North American Ale,American-Style Pale Ale

Itâ€™s the place usually identified with landfills, pipelines, mob burials (alleged) and sports teams that say theyâ€™re from New York.

Although no longer home to forests of giant cedars and salt hay marshes teeming with aquatic life, the Meadowlands is still an amazingly diverse ecosystem providing vital animal and plant habitat. In a nod to a once common food plant here, weâ€™ve brewed this beer with wild rice. We also used brown and white rice, as well as two malts.

Rice helps the beer ferment dry to better showcase the five different hops weâ€™ve added. Lots and lots of them. We then dry-hopped this Double IPA with even more-generous additions of Chinook and Citra hops to create a nose that hints at tangerine, mango, papaya and pine.",North American Ale,Imperial or Double India Pale Ale

Vigneronne,5.0,Brasserie-Brouwerij Cantillon,Anderlecht,Belgium,50.8416,4.3355,"The name Vigneronne Cantillon was given in 1987.

In spite of its success, the Vigneronne represents less than 5% of the total production of the Cantillon brewery. In order to obtain grapes which are as mature as possible, we buy them at the end of the season. Every year, 1000 kilos of white italian grapes are delivered at the Cantillon brewery in the beginning of October.",Belgian and French Ale,Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic

The natural flavours of the beans selected and hand roasted by our friends at the Union Coffee Roasters go well with the roast barley in the beer to give a silky-smooth drink with distinct chocolate and vanilla notes. 

Our first formulation of this beer was the first UK brewed beer to carry the Fairtrade logo, and, although we have reformulated it to create an even better blend of malt and roast coffee flavours, we can no longer get enough coffee in each bottle to qualify for Fairtrade status. However we are still using the same Faitrade Araba Bourbon beans from Rwandaâ€™s Abuhuzamugambi Bakawa Co-operative.

At the Meantime Brewing Co we love flavour, so it wasnâ€™t exactly difficult for us to see how the scents and aromas of coffee and barley would create a perfect match like just like mint and lamb, toffee and banana, peaches and cream, peanut butter and jam.
